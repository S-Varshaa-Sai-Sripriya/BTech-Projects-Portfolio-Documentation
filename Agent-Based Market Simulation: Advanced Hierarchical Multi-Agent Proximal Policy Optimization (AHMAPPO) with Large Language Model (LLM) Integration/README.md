🧠 Agent-Based Market Simulation with AHMAPPO + LLMs

Topics: Reinforcement Learning, LLM

A scalable, research-driven market simulation framework integrating Advanced Hierarchical Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (AHMAPPO) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for financial forecasting and automated trading.

This system emulates realistic stock market dynamics via agent-based modeling, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and LLM-powered decision augmentation to outperform baseline models in market prediction accuracy and adaptability.

🚀 Core Components:

    📈 Historical stock data ingestion via yfinance

    🧹 Robust time series preprocessing

    🤖 Multi-agent PPO architecture using Stable-Baselines3

    🧠 LLM integration (e.g., HuggingFace Transformers) for contextual decision support

    🧪 Model evaluation and benchmarking vs traditional models

🛠️ Tech Stack:
PyTorch, Transformers, Pandas, NumPy, Stable-Baselines3, yfinance, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
