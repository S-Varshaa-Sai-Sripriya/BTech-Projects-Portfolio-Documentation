## Project Overview

This repository contains the design and analysis of stepped-constant tapered slot antennas (TSAs) with both rectangular/square and circular cavity configurations. The project was developed using CST Studio Suite for electromagnetic simulation and performance evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Two antenna configurations**: Rectangular/square and circular cavity designs
- **High-performance characteristics**:
  - Symmetric radiation patterns in E and H planes
  - Omnidirectional radiation pattern
  - Wide bandwidth operation (3.1-10.6 GHz)
- **Optimized design** with 15-17 stepped sections for improved performance
- **Comprehensive analysis** of gain, directivity, radiation patterns, and S-parameters

## Design Specifications

| Parameter              | Rectangular Design | Circular Design |
