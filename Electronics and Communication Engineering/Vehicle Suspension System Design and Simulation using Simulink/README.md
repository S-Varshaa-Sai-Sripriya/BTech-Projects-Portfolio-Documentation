# Vehicle Suspension System Design and Simulation using Simulink

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the modeling, analysis, and simulation of automotive suspension systems using MATLAB Simulink. The work compares passive, semi-active, and active suspension configurations through quarter-car modeling techniques, with emphasis on ride comfort and road handling performance.

## Key Features
- **Quarter-Car Modeling**: Implements 2-DOF system with sprung/unsprung masses
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluates passive vs active suspension performance
- **Simulink Implementation**: Graphical simulation of dynamic responses
- **Parameter Optimization**: Analyzes effects of damping ratios and mass distribution
- **Disturbance Response**: Tests system with step inputs simulating road imperfections

## System Components
### Mathematical Model
The quarter-car system is represented by:
```
M₁ẍ₁ + Bₛ(ẋ₁-ẋ₂) + Kₛ(x₁-x₂) = Fₐ
M₂ẍ₂ + Bₛ(ẋ₂-ẋ₁) + Kₛ(x₂-x₁) + Kₜx₂ = 0
```
Where:
- M₁ = Body mass (2500 kg)
- M₂ = Suspension mass (320 kg)
- Kₛ = Suspension spring constant (80,000 N/m)
- Kₜ = Tire spring constant (500,000 N/m)
- Bₛ = Damping coefficient (350 Ns/m)

## Simulation Results
### Performance Characteristics
1. **Step Response Analysis**:
   - Settling time: 1.2 seconds

   - Resonance peaks within safe 1-1.5Hz range

3. **Comparative Performance**:
   - Active systems show 30% better vibration isolation
   - 25% reduction in body roll compared to passive systems
