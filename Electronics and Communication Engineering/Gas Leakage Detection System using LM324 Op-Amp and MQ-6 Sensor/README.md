# Gas Leakage Detection System using LM324 Op-Amp and MQ-6 Sensor  

## Project Overview  
This project implements a gas leakage detection system that identifies hazardous LPG leaks using an MQ-6 gas sensor and LM324 operational amplifier. The system triggers visual (LED) and audible (buzzer) alerts upon detecting gas concentrations above a safe threshold, enhancing safety in homes and industrial settings.  

## Key Features  
- **Real-time Gas Detection**: MQ-6 sensor detects LPG leaks and converts gas concentration to analog voltage.  
- **Comparator Circuit**: LM324 op-amp compares sensor output with a preset reference voltage to determine leakage.  
- **Instant Alerts**: Activates red LEDs and buzzer upon gas detection.  
- **Power Management**: Uses LM7805 voltage regulators to provide stable 5V supply for sensitive components.  
- **Fail-safe Indicators**: Green LED indicates normal operation; red LEDs + buzzer signal leakage.  

## Components Used  
| Category | Components |  
|----------|------------|  
| **Power Supply** | 12V adapter, bridge rectifier (W04), 1000ÂµF capacitor, LM7805 voltage regulators |  
| **Sensing & Control** | MQ-6 gas sensor, LM324 op-amp, 10K preset potentiometer |  
| **Indicators** | Red/Green LEDs, 5V buzzer |  
| **Switching** | BC547 transistor, push-button switch |  
| **Miscellaneous** | PCB board, jumper wires, 14-pin DIP socket |  

## Working Principle  
1. **Step-down & Rectification**: 230V AC is converted to 12V DC via transformer and bridge rectifier.  
2. **Voltage Regulation**: LM7805 ICs regulate 12V DC to 5V for the MQ-6 sensor and op-amp.  
3. **Gas Sensing**: MQ-6 outputs analog voltage proportional to gas concentration.  
4. **Comparator Action**: LM324 compares sensor voltage with preset reference. If sensor voltage exceeds reference, the output goes high.  
5. **Alert Activation**: High output triggers BC547 transistor, activating buzzer and red LEDs.  

## Applications  
- **Household Safety**: Detects LPG leaks in kitchens.  
- **Industrial Monitoring**: Identifies gas leaks in factories/storage units.  
- **Automotive**: Monitors fuel leaks in vehicles.  
- **Portable Devices**: Can be integrated into handheld detectors for fieldwork.  

## Future Enhancements  
- **IoT Integration**: Send alerts via SMS/email using Wi-Fi/GSM modules.  
- **Automatic Shut-off**: Solenoid valve to cut gas supply during leaks.  
- **Multi-Gas Detection**: Expand sensor array for methane, propane, etc.  
- **Data Logging**: Record gas levels over time for analysis.
